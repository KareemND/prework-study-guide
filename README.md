# Prework Study Guide Wepbage   
## Description
This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
My motivation was to learn while attempting to help others go through the prework for the bootcamp.
I built this project to allow others to easily reach all the notes required to get themselves up and running in this course.
It solves the issue of trying to go through notes in the prework module by having all the notes available in a simple webpage.
I learned how to build the backbone of a webpage using HTML. In addition, I learned how to add design and functionality using CSS and JavaScript and linking them to the HTML.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
