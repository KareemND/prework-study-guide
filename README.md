# prework-study-guide

## Description
This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
My motivation was to help other students go through the prework module.
I built this project to allow other students to easily access notes required to go through the topics of the prework with ease.
It solves the problem of having to navigate through the many modules of the prework to find the information they might need. Instead, they will find a summary of the notes on the webpage
I learned how to build a backbone for the webpage using HTML. In additon, I learned how to add style and logic to the webpage using CSS and JavaScript respectively

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
